# How to Start a New DS Project

## Introduction



## Process for Starting a New Project

This repo discusses the following steps to help you choose a project and work on it in ways that will support your professional growth.

1. Clarify Your Goals and Timeframe
2. Pick Your Project
3. Define the Deliverables and Timeline
4. Establish Quality Standards

## Clarify Your Goals and Timeframe

The two essential questions for any new project you choose are "What do you hope to get out of it?" and "How much can you put into it?" The answers to these questions need to align with each other and with the level of investment you are able to make in your project.

### Prioritize Your Goals

There are many possible goals for any new project - which ones are most important to you? Clarifying this up front will make it much easier for you to say "No" to a project that is a bad fit for you, as well as to recognize when you've found the right project to pursue.

- Expand your portfolio
- Help you reinforce skills you've learned
- Help you learn a new skill
- Develop your knowledge of a specific domain or industry
- Contribute to a community or cause you care about
- Build a product with real-world value
- Earn some cash
- Grow your professional network
- Do something you find interesting

**Activity:** Create a ranked list of goals for your new project to answer this prompt: **What are the 3 most important things you would like to get out of your new project?** For each goal you choose, write a few sentences about why that goal is important to you.

### Create a Rough Timeline

A rough timeline for your project will help you confirm that your goals are attainable in the time you have available. Here are a few considerations when creating your timeline:

- **Start your search early** to make sure that you don't miss out on great projects. Some opportunities require applications that require time to process, or setting up profiles that require time to garner attention. We recommend starting this process at least a month before you think you will want to devote substantial time actually working on your project. Doing this early will also help you to better clarify your goals by exposing you to the universe of possible projects.
- **Set a firm deadline for your search** to ensure you don't use up all your project time before doing any actual data science. There are unlimited projects you _could_ pursue - selecting one will require you to accept that there are other exciting projects you're missing out on... for now.
- **Map out your availability** so you don't run into a time crunch. It's great to take a vacation, just make sure you build that into your timeline. Alternatively, if you know you'll have a bunch of time to work on your project, set yourself up to be able to dig in when the time comes.
- **Carve out blocks of uninterrupted time** so you can focus on your project work. For example, most people will get much more done if they can spend 2 hours at a time on a project, rather than trying to make progress across multiple 30 minute blocks.
- **Set a firm deadline for your project** to ensure that you have something to show for all your work. A project is different from other learning experiences because the expectation is that you will produce something tangible at the end of it. The pressure to create this product by your deadline will help you along the way to make the tough choices about what to include or exclude from your project.

Here is an example of a rough week-by-week timeline aligned with the Month-by-Month Overview in the [DS Post-Grad Roadmap][]:

- Month 2, Week 1: Complete "Prioritize Your Goals" (2 hours) and "Create a Rough Timeline" (2 hours)
- Month 2, Week 2: Begin "Consider Open Projects" (4 hours)
- Month 2, Week 3: Begin "Reach Out" (4 hours)
- Month 2, Week 4: Begin "Weigh Pros and Cons" (2 hours)
- Month 3, Week 1: Complete "Look for Open Projects" (4 hours)
- Month 3, Week 2: Complete "Reach Out" (4 hours)
- Month 3, Week 3: Complete "Weigh Pros and Cons" (2 hours)
- Month 3, Week 4: Complete "Flesh Out Final Two" (4 hours)
- Month 4, Week 1: Complete "Project Plan" (5 hours) and "Problem Definition" (15 hours)
- Each week thereafter: Work on project according to plan (20 hours)

**Activity:** Enter your rough timeline into your calendar of choice. We recommend using [Google Calendar][], but feel free to use another program. [Set up recurring events][] so activities occur at a regular time without having to copy-and-paste, and you can edit individual occurrences as needed. You can even [add reminders][] to help you avoid forgetting.

## Pick Your Project

You need a project you'll be motivated to work on. [Potential Project Tracker][]

### Consider for Open Projects

There are many open projects that you may be able to join. Here are four sources for you to consider:

- **Community projects** let you use your data science skills in service of a real-world project that a specific community has identified as a need. These projects may not be well-defined or funded, but can help motivate you because you know there is a constituent eager for your work. These can be especially rewarding when they are done in service of a cause you care about.
  - [DataKind][] coordinates pairs data scientists with non-profits that need their help with projects.
  - [Code for America][] organizes local groups of coders to work on projects addressing civic issues.
- **Competition projects** let you engage in data science in a community of peers who support you via friendly competition. We recommend working on an active competition and finding teammates who will collaborate with you, either from your cohort or through Kaggle. Placing highly in a competition is something you can put on your resume and can even provide a cash reward!
  - [Kaggle][] is the most popular DS competition site, with many active competitions, users, and learning resources.
  - [DrivenData][] is a DS competition site focused on projects for social good.
  - Check out this article about [Top Competitive Data Science Platforms other than Kaggle][].  
- **Consulting projects** let you build professional relationships and earn money while working on an real-world project. You may find consulting opportunities via networking or through freelancing sites, such as [Upwork][]. The prospect of making money while improving your skills and building your portfolio may be enticing, but there are a number of complications to consider:
  - Much of consulting work is managing your client - this can be a supportive process or extremely challenging, depending on the client.
  - Don't let them occupy all of your time - reserve at least half of your time for your proper job search and Career Services Commitments.
  - Make sure the project is the right fit for you - you don't want something boring that doesn't develop your skills or something beyond what you are realistically able to do.
  - Before you start, check if the client is OK with you adding the project to your portfolio.
- **Personal projects** are projects you pursue simply because they are of interest to you. They may or may not translate into a specific product or be of value to a specific stakeholder. They also require you to have a clear idea of what you want to build and the discipline to structure the project yourself. However, these projects can be very motivating because they can be anything you want! They also can be great additions to your portfolio to demonstrate your unique talents and interests.

**Activity:** Browse open project opportunities and identify three or more that you would be interested in joining. The opportunities you choose should align with the goals and timeline you established in the previous section. Add them to your [Potential Project Tracker][].

**Activity:** Come up with one or more personal project ideas. If you could do anything, what would you do? Add these ideas to your [Potential Project Tracker][].

### Reach Out

If you are interested in doing a community or consulting project, you will greatly expand the options available to you by reaching out proactively to people for whom you'd like to work. You might think that it is a waste of time or annoying to essentially "cold call" people about projects, but the potential payoff is large. Not only might you find a great project or build a new professional relationship, but you will also build your ability to demonstrate value for real-world stakeholders. The person you reach out to may even refer you to an open position, especially since you've shown your initiative and ability to communicate with them professionally.

**Activity:** Identify three or more communities or organizations that you would like to work with. Research them to understand their potential needs and the right person to contact about potentially working with them. Come up with an idea for a project you could work on for them. Then, send them an email introducing yourself, why you want to work with them, your project pitch, and an invitation to discuss it further. Add these pitches to your [Potential Project Tracker][].
