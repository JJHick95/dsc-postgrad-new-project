# How to Start a New DS Project

## Introduction

Congratulations, you are now ready to start your first complete data science project all on your own!! You have demonstrated that you can do a complete project with your Capstone - now you will need to do it without structure or feedback from an instructor. This lesson will give you some recommendations about how to go about it to help your project be successful.

## Learning Objectives

You will be able to...

- Choose a project that will achieve your goals
- Create a project plan to guide your work

## Process for Starting a New Project

You may be tempted to jump headlong into the first project you think of - be cautious of this impulse. Some successful projects start out this way, but many others will simply fizzle out as the work becomes difficult or tedious. While this can be a valuable learning experience if you view it with that lens, it can also be demoralizing. Moreover, it is unlikely to help you achieve your goals.

This lesson outlines a process to help increase the chances that your project is successful. Specifically, it walks through the following steps to help you choose a project and work on it in ways that will support your professional growth.

1. Clarify Your Goals and Availability
2. Pick Your Project
3. Create a Project Plan

## Clarify Your Goals and Availability

The two essential questions for any new project you choose are "What do you hope to get out of it?" and "How much can you put into it?" The answers to these questions need to align with each other and with the level of investment you are actually able to make in your project.

### Prioritize Your Goals

There are many possible goals for any new project - which ones are most important to you? Clarifying this up front will make it much easier for you to say "No" to a project that is a bad fit for you, as well as to recognize when you've found the right project to pursue.

- Expand your portfolio
- Help you reinforce skills you've learned
- Help you learn a new skill
- Develop your knowledge of a specific domain or industry
- Contribute to a community or cause you care about
- Build a product with real-world value
- Earn some cash
- Grow your professional network
- Do something intellectually interesting

You might think that all of these goals should be achievable in one project, but as you dig in further you will likely find you'll need to make some trade-offs. For example, you might consider a project to develop your data engineering skills by hosting data in AWS and using SQL queries to pull data for some Tableau visualizations. This could help you expand your portfolio, reinforce some skills, and help you learn new ones, but it may not achieve any of the other goals. Alternatively, you could reach out to a local non-profit and offer to do some data work for them to contribute to a community you care about, build a product with real-world value, and grow your professional network, if those goals were more important to you.

**Activity:** Create a ranked list of goals for your new project to answer this prompt: **What are the 3 most important things you would like to get out of your new project?** For each goal you choose, write a few sentences about why that goal is important to you.

### Create a Rough Timeline

A rough timeline for your project will help you confirm that your goals are attainable in the time you have available. Here are a few considerations when creating your timeline:

- **Start your search early** to make sure that you don't miss out on great projects. Some opportunities require applications that require time to process, or setting up profiles that require time to garner attention. We recommend starting this process at least a month before you think you will want to devote substantial time actually working on your project. Doing this early will also help you to better clarify your goals by exposing you to the universe of possible projects.
- **Set a firm deadline for your search** to ensure you don't use up all your project time before doing any actual data science. There are unlimited projects you _could_ pursue - selecting one will require you to accept that there are other exciting projects you're missing out on... for now.
- **Map out your availability** so you don't run into a time crunch. It's great to take a vacation, just make sure you build that into your timeline. Alternatively, if you know that you'll have extra time some month, set yourself up to be able to capitalize on that.
- **Carve out blocks of uninterrupted time** so you can focus on your project work. For example, most people will get much more done if they can spend 2 hours at a time on a project, rather than trying to make progress across multiple 30 minute blocks.
- **Set a firm deadline for your project** to ensure that you have something to show for all your work. A project is different from other learning experiences because the expectation is that you will produce something tangible at the end of it. The pressure to create this product by your deadline will help you along the way to make the tough choices about what to include or exclude from your project.

Here is an example of a rough week-by-week timeline aligned with the Month-by-Month Overview in the [DS Post-Grad Roadmap][]:

- Month 2, Week 1: Complete "Prioritize Your Goals" (2 hours) and "Create a Rough Timeline" (2 hours)
- Month 2, Week 2: Begin "Consider Open Projects" (4 hours)
- Month 2, Week 3: Begin "Reach Out" (4 hours)
- Month 2, Week 4: Begin "Weigh Pros and Cons" (4 hours)
- Month 3, Week 1: Complete "Look for Open Projects" (4 hours)
- Month 3, Week 2: Complete "Reach Out" (4 hours)
- Month 3, Week 3: Begin "Weigh Pros and Cons" (4 hours)
- Month 3, Week 4: Complete "Weigh Pros and Cons" (3 hours) and "Make Your Choice" (3 hours)
- Month 4, Week 1: Complete "Project Plan" (5 hours) and work on project according to your Project Plan (15 hours)
- Each week thereafter: Work on project according to your Project Plan (20 hours)

**Activity:** Enter your rough timeline into your calendar of choice. We recommend using [Google Calendar][], but feel free to use another program. [Set up recurring events][] so activities occur at a regular time without having to copy-and-paste, and you can edit individual occurrences as needed. You can even [add reminders][] to help you avoid forgetting.

## Pick Your Project

Choosing the right project is critically important to your project's success. By choosing a project that you'll be motivated to work on, that is aligned with your goals, and that has a reasonable path to completion, you will make your work in the following weeks much easier and more rewarding.

**Activity:** Create a [Potential Project Tracker][] by clicking the link. You will use this document to keep track of the projects that you are considering.

### Consider Open Projects

There are many open projects that you may be able to join. Here are four sources for you to consider:

- **Community projects** let you use your data science skills in service of a real-world project that a specific community has identified as a need. These projects may not be well-defined or funded, but can help motivate you because you know there is a constituent eager for your work. These can be especially rewarding when they are done in service of a cause you care about.
  - [DataKind][] coordinates pairs data scientists with non-profits that need their help with projects.
  - [Code for America][] organizes local groups of coders to work on projects addressing civic issues.
- **Competition projects** let you engage in data science in a community of peers who support you via friendly competition. We recommend working on an active competition and finding teammates who will collaborate with you, either from your cohort or through Kaggle. Placing highly in a competition is something you can put on your resume and can even provide a cash reward!
  - [Kaggle][] is the most popular DS competition site, with many active competitions, users, and learning resources.
  - [DrivenData][] is a DS competition site focused on projects for social good.
  - Check out this article about [Top Competitive Data Science Platforms other than Kaggle][].  
- **Consulting projects** let you build professional relationships and earn money while working on an real-world project. You may find consulting opportunities via networking or through freelancing sites, such as [Upwork][]. The prospect of making money while improving your skills and building your portfolio may be enticing, but there are a number of complications to consider:
  - Much of consulting work is managing your client - this can be a supportive process or extremely challenging, depending on the client.
  - Don't let them occupy all of your time - reserve at least half of your time for your proper job search and Career Services Commitments.
  - Make sure the project is the right fit for you - you don't want something boring that doesn't develop your skills or something beyond what you are realistically able to do.
  - Before you start, check if the client is OK with you adding the project to your portfolio.
- **Personal projects** are projects you pursue simply because they are of interest to you. They may or may not translate into a specific product or be of value to a specific stakeholder. They also require you to have a clear idea of what you want to build and the discipline to structure the project yourself. However, these projects can be very motivating because they can be anything you want! They also can be great additions to your portfolio to demonstrate your unique talents and interests.

**Activity:** Browse open project opportunities and identify three or more that you would be interested in joining. The opportunities you choose should align with the goals and timeline you established in the previous section. Add them to your [Potential Project Tracker][].

**Activity:** Come up with one or more personal project ideas. If you could do anything, what would you do? Add these ideas to your [Potential Project Tracker][].

### Reach Out Proactively

If you are interested in doing a community or consulting project, you will greatly expand the options available to you by reaching out proactively to people for whom you'd like to work. You might think that it is a waste of time or annoying to essentially "cold call" people about projects, but the potential payoff is large. Not only might you find a great project or build a new professional relationship, but you will also build your ability to demonstrate value for real-world stakeholders. The person you reach out to may even refer you to an open position, especially since you've shown your initiative and ability to communicate professionally.

**Activity:** Identify three or more communities or organizations that you would like to work with. Research them to understand their potential needs and the right person to contact about potentially working with them. Come up with an idea for a project you could work on for them. Then, send them an email introducing yourself, why you want to work with them, your project pitch, and an invitation to discuss it further. Add these pitches to your [Potential Project Tracker][].

### Weigh Pros and Cons

The due diligence you put in up front to vet an idea can help avoid many of the pitfalls that sink promising projects. Here is a list of questions to help surface some pros and cons for each project idea:

- How well does the project align with your goals?
- How hard will it be to acquire and clean your data?
- Has anyone else tried this kind of project before? If so, what was their experience?
- What technical skills will this project require?
- Do you have the software and hardware necessary?
- How far out of your comfort zone is this project? Is there supporting material available?
- How well will the data support your analysis (e.g. number of observations, labeled data)?
- How likely are you to develop a model/solution that performs well?
- Are there any external dependencies (e.g. people who need to give you access to data)?
- How relevant is this project to the real world?
- How would you share or deploy this project?
- Are there any ethical considerations for this project?

Do whatever you need to in order to feel confident in your answers to these questions. This may mean doing some exploratory data analysis, contacting somebody about a data source, reading relevant blog posts, or asking for input from your fellow alumni.

**Activity:** Use your [Potential Project Tracker][] to write down the pros and cons for each of your project ideas. If there are any ideas that don't seem worth the effort or that you learn have major cons, cross them off your list.

### Make Your Choice

Now that you've done your due diligence and eliminated some of your project ideas, it's time to choose among the remaining ideas. Weigh the pros and cons for each project, and see which one jumps out at you as the best. Your intuition is a powerful tool for making decisions, especially once you've done the leg work to make an informed choice. If you find yourself torn among the remaining project ideas, here are some steps you can take to help make your decision:

- Revisit the questions above and do some additional work to answer each one fully
- Spend 1-2 hours actually beginning work on the project and see how you feel about it
- Ask for input from your fellow alumni

If all else fails, you can flip a coin or roll a die to choose among the remaining projects. If you find that you are disappointed with the result, then cross that one off the list and try again.

**Activity:** Go through the steps above to choose your project from among the options in your [Potential Project Tracker][].

## Create a Project Plan

Once you've picked your project, you'll have enough information to write up a project plan. While there will certainly be adjustments as you go, having a plan to start from will help you start figuring out the path to completion. Project management is a valuable skill in the workplace, so take this opportunity to intentionally develop this skill.

We recommend that you put your project plan in writing, rather than just keeping it in your head. Doing so will force you to clarify your plans and will save you time later when it's time to write up our project. We have created a template for your [DS Project Plan][], including the following elements:

1. Project Overview
2. Deliverables
3. Timeline
4. Evaluation

### Project Overview

Your project overview is your opportunity to practice making a concise statement of what your project is about. It will also serve as a reference for you when evaluating the success of your project and when producing your repository content. We recommend that it include 1-3 paragraphs containing the following:

- Project goals
- Motivation - why is this project important/valuable?
- Brief review of data, tools and/or methods involved

**Activity:** Add your project overview to your [DS Project Plan][].

### Deliverables

Getting a clear sense of your deliverables is necessary for creating and sticking to a timeline. What are the specific products you'll have to show at the end of the project? Here are some common answers - we recommend having more than one deliverable for any project.

- GitHub repository
- Blog and/or social media post
- Presentation slides and/or recording
- Web app
- Interactive visualizations
- Article for a website or journal

When choosing deliverables, be as specific as you can about the content of those deliverables. For example, if you plan to build a web app, be specific about the functionality it should have. If you plan to write an article, specify the length and where you plan to submit it.

**Activity:** Add your deliverables to your [DS Project Plan][], including as much detail as possible.

### Timeline

Your timeline should help you make sure that you are on track to produce your deliverables. By recording your intended timeline and checking in with it weekly, you can see if you are making more or less progress than expected and adjusting the timeline or the way you are working. We recommend that you create a weekly timeline containing the following:

- Activities for each week
- Intermediate deliverables - pieces of the final deliverable to be completed
- Deadline for MVP of each deliverable
- Deadline for complete version of each deliverable

We recommend starting with the final deadline, and working backwards from there - this will help you think about a realistic schedule of intermediate steps.

**Activity:** Add a weekly timeline to your [DS Project Plan][].

### Evaluation

How will you know if your work was good? Figuring this out in advance will help keep you on track to produce high-quality work that meets your goals. By knowing the target you are trying to hit in advance, you will make choices along the way to help you get there.

- If you plan to create a GitHub repository and/or presentation, we recommend you use the [DS Capstone Rubric][] to evaluate them.
- For an article or post, set a goal for length, publication quality, or reader engagement.
- For a web app or interactive visualization, set a goal for features, usage, or performance.

**Activity:** Add your plan for evaluating your work in [DS Project Plan][].

## Summary

Starting your next DS project is like an epic journey. Once you know your motivations, you embark on a journey to achieve what you want. You prepare everything you need, set your destination, sketch out a route, and head off. The more you can do to set yourself up with a clear path, the better able you will be to reach your goal. While this might seem like a lot more work, this is the sort of project preparation that enables substantial projects to be successful.
