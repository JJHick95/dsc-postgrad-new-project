# How to Start a New DS Project

## Introduction



## Process for Starting a New Project

This repo discusses the following steps to help you choose a project and work on it in ways that will support your professional growth.

1. Clarify Your Goals and Timeframe
2. Pick Your Project
3. Define the Deliverables and Timeline
4. Establish Quality Standards

## Clarify Your Goals and Timeframe

The two essential questions for any new project you choose are "What do you hope to get out of it?" and "How much can you put into it?" The answers to these questions need to align with each other and with your actual interests and availability for your project to be successful.

### Prioritize Your Goals

There are many possible goals for any new project - which ones are most important to you? Clarifying this up front will make it much easier for you to say "No" to a project that is a bad fit for you, as well as to recognize when you've found the right project to pursue.

- Expand your portfolio
- Help you reinforce skills you've learned
- Help you learn a new skill
- Develop your knowledge of a specific domain or industry
- Contribute to a community or cause you care about
- Build a product with real-world value
- Earn some cash
- Grow your professional network

**Activity:** Create a ranked list of goals for your new project to answer this prompt: **What are the 3 most important things you would like to get out of your new project?** For each goal you choose, write a few sentences about why that goal is important to you.

### Create a Rough Timeline

A rough timeline for your project will help you confirm that your goals are attainable in the time you have available. Here are a few considerations when creating your timeline:

- **Start your search early** to make sure that you don't miss out on great projects. Some opportunities require applications that require time to process, or setting up profiles that require time to garner attention. We recommend starting this process at least a month before you think you will want to devote substantial time actually working on your project. Doing this early will ao help you to better clarify your goals by exposing you to the universe of project possibilities.
- **Set a firm deadline for your search** to ensure you don't use up all your project time before doing any actual data science. There are unlimited projects you _could_ pursue - selecting one will require you to accept that there are other exciting projects you might be missing out on... for now.
- **Map out your availability** so you don't run into a time crunch. It's great to take a vacation, just make sure you build that into your timeine. Alternatively, if you know you'll have a bunch of time to work on your project, set yourself up to be able to dig in when the time comes.
- **Carve out blocks of uninterrupted time** so you can focus on your project work. For example, most people will get much more done if they can spend 2 hours at a time on a project, rather than trying to make progress across multiple 30 minute blocks.
- **Set a firm deadline for your project** to ensure that you have something to show for all your work. A project is different from other learning experiences because the expectation is that you will produce something tangible at the end of it. The pressure to create this product by your deadline will help you along the way to make the tough choices about what to include or exclude from your project.

Here is an example of a rough week-by-week timeline aligned with the Month-by-Month Overview in the [DS Post-Grad Roadmap][]:

- Month 2, Week 1: Complete "Clarify Goals and Timeframe" activities (4 hours)
- Week 2: Begin "Pick Your Project" activities
- Week 3: Continue "Pick Your Project" activities
- Week 4: Complete "Pick Your Project" activities

**Activity:** Enter your rough timeline into your calendar of choice. We recommend using [Google Calendar][], but feel free to use another program. [Set up recurring events][] so activities occur at a regular time without having to copy-and-paste, and you can edit individual occurrences as needed. You can even [add reminders][] to help you avoid forgetting.

## Pick Your Project


### Look for Inspiration

There are many sources of inspiration for a new project, any of which you might find interesting. Here are four sources for you to consider:

- **Community projects** let you use your data science skills in service of a real-world project that a specific community has identified as a need. These projects may not be well-defined or funded, but can help motivate you because you know there is a constituent eager for your work. These can be especially rewarding when they are done in service of a cause you care about.
  - [DataKind][] coordinates pairs data scientists with non-profits that need their help with projects.
  - [Code for America][] organizes local groups of coders to work on projects addressing civic issues.
  - Reach out to people or organizations that you follow and offer your services - this also is a great way to build your profesional network!
- **Competition projects** let you engage in data science in a community of peers who support you via friendly competition. We recommend working on an active competition and finding teammates who will collaborate with you, either from your cohort or through Kaggle. Placing highly in a competition is something you can put on your resume and can even provide a cash reward!
  - [Kaggle][] is the most popular DS competition site, with many active competitions, users, and learning resources.
  - [DrivenData][] is a DS competition site focused on projects for social good.
  - Check out this article about [Top Competitive Data Science Platforms other than Kaggle][].  
- **Consulting projects** let you earn some income while working on an real-world project. You may come across consulting opportunities when networking or through freelancing sites, such as [Upwork][]. The prospect of making money while improving your skills and building your portfolio may be enticing, but there are a number of complications to consider:
  - Much of consulting work is managing your client - this can be a supportive process or extremely challenging, depending on the client.
  - Don't let them occupy all of your time - reserve at least half of your time for your proper job search and Career Services Commitments.
  - Make sure the project is the right fit for you - you don't want something boring that doesn't develop your skills or something beyond what you are realistically able to do.
  - Before you start, check if the client is OK with you adding the project to your portfolio.
- **Personal projects** are projects you pursue simply because they are of interest to you. They may or may not translate into a specific product or be of value to a specific stakeholder. They also require you to have a clear idea of what you want to build and the discipline to structure the project yourself. However, these projects can be very motivating because they can be anything you want! They also can be great additions to your portfolio to demonstrate your unique talents and interests.
